# [United Nation Secrity Council Voting](https://arthurjr1.github.io/UNcodechunk/)

This is an example from my Data Analysis class assignment that required me to find a topic I'm interested in within international affairs and do an audiovisual presentation on the data. I decided to look at the UN voting dataset and focus on the permanent members of the security council voting trend. I was interested in examining how often the permanent members vote "abstention" throughout the years, since their power in the UN is significant. 

I chose code chunks from this assignment to show my ability to code within `Rmarkdown`. [Click here to view](https://arthurjr1.github.io/UNcodechunk/) the code chunks and ouputs.
